## robo-cheesecake Readme :cake:
An engine for learning probabilistic movement primitives from demonstrations in joint space, for a Panda robot from Franka Emika. Check `engine.py` for the code.


    The methods implemented were adapted for two papers by the labs of Jan Peters in TÃ¼bingen and Darmstadt.
    These papers are:
        
        
        [1]. Using Probabilistic Movement Primitives in Robotics

        and

        Also there's input from
