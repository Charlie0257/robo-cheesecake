## robo-cheesecake Readme :cake:
An engine for learning probabilistic movement primitives from demonstrations in joint space. Implemented and tested on a Panda robot from Franka Emika. Check `engine.py` for the code. Released in Open Source with an MIT License.


    The methods implemented were adapted for two papers by the labs of Jan Peters in TÃ¼bingen and Darmstadt.
    These papers are:
